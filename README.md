There are countless of apps that help track tasks, but this app is unique because it is geared more towards students who would like a  specifically for school. The app will allow students to add tasks, categorize tasks, and interact with a calendar that contains tasks for that day or month.

- User can mark or delete their task when completed.
- User will be able to see their tasks on a Calendar.
- User is able to click a floating icon to view randomly selected displayed message. 
- App includes search bar to search for user's tasks.
- App includes filter icon to filter out tasks by selecting "today", "this week", or "this month".

## Milestone 1 Getting Set Up:

- Create a GitHub project, make sure each member is invited as collaborators.
- Create a readme for your team. Your proposal will live in the readme of your project.
- Create a proposal
- Must have features
- Nice to have feature
- Create some basic wire-frames for your main feature
Additional considerations for grading:
- Each user has to have contributed to the readme. The entire team is responsible for this.

## Milestone 2 Prototype:
 Estimate how much work each feature will take to implement (in hours)
- Assign owners for features and add up work estimates for each owner. Each group member
should have a similar work-load
- Designs
- Wire frames for all your “Must-have features”
- Finalize “Must-have features”
From this point on you are committed to these features.
- Working UI for key parts of the app

## Milestone 3 Submission:
Additional considerations for grading:
- You implemented all of your must-have features
- You contributed approximately an equal amount to the code base (equal in difficulty and
amount of code)
