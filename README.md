# Project Proposal
Our project will be inspired by the todo app done in class with Professor Essellmann. We want to implement a task manager app that 
is geared towards students to help them sort out their school tasks.

### Must-have features
- The todo app will have multiple pages. 
- Main page will have a list of tasks added by the user. 
- User will be able to click "add task" and be sent to the corresponding page.
- User will be able to delete tasks
- When setting a task, user will be able to assign a date and time for that task. 
- User will be able to push a button labeled "Reminder" and be sent to the corresponding page.

### Nice-to-have features
- User will be able to search for tasks in the search bar.
- User will be able to filter tasks using the drop down menu.
- User will be able to view a calender containing their events.
- User will be able to add tasks and categorize them by task "type"
- User will be able to mark a task as completed
- User will be able to click a floating icon to view randomly selected displayed message

***Please read carefully all the guidelines described in this README file. ***
# Goals:

* Have fun building an app (together) that you can be proud of
* Learn from each other
* Have something to show to future employers

# General Project Guidelines:

-The app should be your own. (Turning in the result of just having followed a tutorial is not
permitted)
- You are allowed to use other people’s work, as long it is attributed. If you use a dependency
through cocoa pods, the pod file is enough attribution for me. If you are copying or adapting
code from a tutorial, please attribute the tutorial you followed. Any code we created in class
you don’t have to attribute.
- Project scope: I would like your project to be a demonstration that you completed this class.
It should solve a non-trivial problem to you that is meaningful. If you are working in a group
the scope should be appropriate to the size of your group.
- Projects of an appropriate size likely either interact with a server (Firebase can give you a
simple backend, there are a lot of free APIs for you to use), or use one or multiple of
apple’s APIs that create a rich app experience (Multimedia, Maps, CoreData, AIKit,
SpriteKit)
- Your app likely has multiple screens
- Too small for individual projects: A tip calculator

# Milestone 1 Getting Set Up:

Decide if you would like to work by yourself or in a group.
- Create a GitHub project, make sure each member is invited as collaborators.
- Submit GitHub link to iLearn
- Create a readme for your team. Your proposal will live in the readme of your project.
- Each member of your team should add their name to the readme and push those changes to
master so we can figure out any GitHub related issues early
- Create a proposal
- Must have features
- Nice to have feature
- Create some basic wire-frames for your main feature
Additional considerations for grading:
- Each user has to have contributed to the readme. The entire team is responsible for this.
- The project you propose is of a scope appropriate for your group size

# Milestone 2 Prototype:
 Estimate how much work each feature will take to implement (in hours)
- Assign owners for features and add up work estimates for each owner. Each group member
should have a similar work-load
- Designs
- Wire frames for all your “Must-have features”
- Finalize “Must-have features”
From this point on you are committed to these features.
- Working UI for key parts of the app

# Milestone 3 Submission:
Additional considerations for grading:
- You implemented all of your must-have features
- You contributed approximately an equal amount to the code base (equal in difficulty and
amount of code)

***Must commit work to the class repository!***
